Microsoft's IE7 Search Box Bugs Google 
Posted by CmdrTaco on Mon May 01, '06 12:38 PM
from the now-wait-a-minute dept. 
  tessaiga writes "The New York Times reports that Google is crying foul over a 
new IE7 search box feature that defaults to MSN Search. Although the feature can 
be modified to use Google or other search engines, Google asserts that "The best 
way to handle the search box [...] would be to give users a choice when they 
first start up Internet Explorer 7." Google goes on to assert that the move 
"limits consumer choice and is reminiscent of the tactics that got Microsoft 
into antitrust trouble in the late 1990s". I notice that in my version of 
Firefox the search box defaults to Google, and that the pulldown menu of 
pre-entered options doesn't even include MSN Search, but Google seems to have 
been oddly quiet on that front for the many years prior to IE7 that Firefox has 
made this feature available."

  Defaults vs. Presets(Score:5, Informative)

  The main difference between the IE7 search box and the Firefox and Opera 
  search boxes is that the IE7 search box comes preloaded with only one search 
  provider: MSN. Firefox and Opera both include a half-dozen or so providers 
  when you install them. (You can add additional search engines in all three.)

  Well, that, and Firefox doesn't have a setting for a "default" provider. It 
  "defaults" to the last one you used, which can be helpful if, say, you use 
  Google most of the time and want to do a bunch of IMDB lookups in a row. (Yes, 
  you can add IMDB as a search engine.) Of course, if you've never used the box 
  before, it starts out with Google...

  Of course, you can always read what the IE team has to say about searching 
  [msdn.com]...

        Search engines pay money to the browser makers to get their search 
        engines in there anyway.

        Um, care to back that up?

        The two biggest browsers right now are IE and Firefox; Microsoft is 
        basically promoting their own product here (MSN Search) so I doubt 
        they're "paying" anything directly, so really your point seems to 
        suggest that Google has paid Firefox to be the default search. That's a 
        pretty strong statement to be making without any evidence.

          Funny, I thought that "accusation" was common knowledge [gigaom.com]. 
          Opera, for instance, hasn't exactly been hiding the fact. Back in 
          September, Jon von Tetzchner said [operawatch.com]:
            What finally made [going free] possible is the increase in revenues 
            from search and service partners. We can now go free and still 
            increase our revenues.
          And later in the same interview:
            We have been working with Google for a long time. Our new search 
            deal increases our search based revenue, which is an important 
            factor in our decision to go free. We are also working with Google 
            to make sure their services work well with Opera.

        I read through these comments and realize that a lot of these readers 
        still do not understand the real issue here. MS OWNS THE OPERATING 
        SYSTEM!! Google does not! Microsoft provides Walmart, Office Max, Sears, 
        Radio Shack, TigerDirect, (and the list goes on) with the PRE-INSTALLED 
        operating system. The vast majority of users have no idea how to install 
        ANYTHING. They are stuck with using what is pre-loaded, and if it works 
        fairly well, they don't complain.
        It does not matter if Google or MSN or Jeeves or any other search engine 
        comes on FireFox or Opera. FireFox and Opera are not part of the 
        pre-loaded OS and therefore are used by only a very small percentage of 
        users.
        The real issue is MICROSOFT "CONTROLS" THE COMPUTER for most people. 
        Whatever is put there stays there, and good or bad, is the only thing 
        they are able to use. That is what is referred to as "Monopolistic 
        Power". This is a re-enactment of the NETSCAPE issue and the present 
        WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER issue. MS is not keeping people from using other 
        search engines. They are just taking advantage of the fact that most 
        people are only able to use what is provided, and by bundling it with 
        the OS, they can say it is free. 
        Since our present administration will not even slap the hand of MS 
        anymore, the only recourse Google will have is to promote by writing a 
        program that loads itself and deletes the MS search engine. Most people 
        would allow that. Like AOL, Google can distribute free CD's in Wallmart 
        and major groceries and even contract with the US Post Office to have 
        CD's distrubuted there.

          I think that's a very telling statement. If it works fairly well, why 
          change? If users can't tell an appreciable difference between two 
          products, why would they care which they use? I can tell very cleary 
          you want them to care, but you're fighting for the rights of 
          individuals who really couldn't care less if the Devil himself 
          performed the internet search and told them the results. 

          So let's recap. People hate installing things. They hate choosing 
          between things they don't understand. And the current option seems 
          just as good as any other to them. Those who do want something else, 
          want to be able to choose... can. 

          This whole thing sounds like a huge non-issue to me.

      There is a major difference between Firefox or Opera defaulting to Google 
      and IE7 defaulting to MSN: neither Firefox or Opera are owned by Google. 
      Google makes no money in the sell of either. Firefox and/or Opera could 
      change their default to MSN if they so desired. Microsoft could even pay 
      them to do that. But Microsoft deploys IE7 and Microsoft makes money on 
      MSN. That is a problem.

        Microsoft could even pay them to do that. But Microsoft deploys IE7 and 
        Microsoft makes money on MSN. 
        That's not quite what the problem is either. 
        The real problem is that it's illegal to abuse monopoly powers by using 
        your (otherwise legal) monopoly in one industry to force users to adopt 
        your inferior product in another industry. 
        For a concrete example - if you have a monopoly in Operating Systems, 
        you can NOT use your operating system monopoly to force users to use 
        your online-store or your media-player or your single-sign-on-service. 
        Google's arguing that you are also not allowed to force people to use 
        your search engine either -- and that users are so unlikely to switch 
        default browsers that making this the default in IE is effectively 
        forcing the users. 
        Firefox does not have this problem, because it is not illegally abusing 
        any monopoly powers.

          If Google has leading market share in the search marketspace, how can 
          they claim that Microsoft's intent to default to MSN in IE7 is a not 
          competative practice. I see how the argument works from the 
          OS/effective monopoly perspective, but the argument seems a little 
          weak if approached a different way.

          IE defaults to MSN as it's home page, correct? Well, MSN search is 
          there. Google's stating that people won't use their search because 
          users won't change the toolbar default is equivalent to saying that 
          people don't change their default home page - which is untrue.

          Where does this end? The default home page? The toolbar option? At 
          some point this gets ridiculous.

          The problem doesn't stem from not being able to make a choice, because 
          the settings can be changed. The problem stems from the public not 
          even understanding the difference between the competitors and not 
          caring to change. Who's fault is that? The entrenched vendor who has 
          no reason to promote its competitors or the competitor who needs to 
          make consumer education a priority?

          In this case, how do you establish that? The OS is entrenched, but 
          Google market share is significant over MSN's search. I mean hell, its 
          almost 50%. [hitslink.com] How can you argue that your dominance is in

            I would have thought this was an easy question by now. Microsoft has 
            a monopoly in the desktop operating system market. Microsoft 
            leverages this monopoly to gain a new monopoly in the web browser 
            market. Now Microsoft is leveraging the browser monopoly to 
            overthrow its competitors and establish a monopoly in the search 
            engine market. Can't you see where this is going? The rules are 
            different when a company develops a monopoly. Up until that point, a 
            practice like this would be considered shrewd business tactics, and 
            provides healthy competition. In fact, it's even OK for their 
            competitors to use this tactic. But when a company that has a 
            monopoly uses tactics like this, it is considered anticompetitive 
            and illegal. They are using a monopoly in one part of the market to 
            gain market share (and eventually set up a monopoly) in another part 
            of the market.
            IE defaults to MSN as it's home page, correct? Well, MSN search is 
            there. Google's stating that people won't use their search because 
            users won't change the toolbar default is equivalent to saying that 
            people don't change their default home page - which is untrue. 
            Actually, it's true. Many people DON'T change their default home 
            page. I helped set up three computers for family and friends in the 
            last two years. Not one of them changed the default page from MSN 
            until I went back later and installed Firefox. In fact, one of them 
            asked me to make MSN the default page for Firefox because that was 
            what they were accustomed to.
            The OS is entrenched, but Google market share is significant over 
            MSN's search. I mean hell, its almost 50%. How can you argue that 
            your dominance is in danger by a company who holds 8%? 
            Google does not yet have a monopoly in the search engine market. But 
            for argument's sake, let's assume that they do. If they used their 
            monopoly in the search engine market to push Google OS and Google 
            Office to their customers (at the obvious expense of competitors), 
            then they would be guilty. It's because the OS (Windows) and 
            Internet Explorer are entrenched that Microsoft could easily erode 
            the dominance that Google has. The 8% market share that MSN Search 
            has means nothing. The 90+% market share that Internet Explorer has 
            means EVERYTHING. Think about it.

            If Google has leading market share in the search marketspace, how 
            can they claim that Microsoft's intent to default to MSN in IE7 is a 
            not competative practice. 
            Easily. MS is using its monopoly to gain an advantage in the new 
            market. That is the whole point and that is what the law forbids.
            IE defaults to MSN as it's home page, correct? Well, MSN search is 
            there. Google's stating that people won't use their search because 
            users won't change the toolbar default is equivalent to saying that 
            people don't change their default home page - which is untrue. 
            No, it is equivalent to them saying not all users will be 
            knowledgeable or motivated enough to change it. Firefox is far 
            superior to IE in most ways. Even the US government recommends all 
            users switch for security reasons. Still most people use IE. That is 
            not because MS has forced them not to switch, it is because most 
            don't know they can or why they should. Thus consumers use an 
            inferior product and everyone suffers (except MS).
            It does not matter that they can switch it. The point is some users 
            won't know they can. Others will know they can, but won't know how. 
            Still others will know they can and how but will be too lazy to 
            bother. The net result is MSN gains marketshare. Can Google set the 
            default browser included with a monopoly on all desktop OS's to 
            google.com? No, they don't have a monopoly to abuse. Thus MS has 
            gained market using their existing monopoly. That is blatantly 
            illegal.
            Where does this end? The default home page? The toolbar option? At 
            some point this gets ridiculous. 
            Legally, all of the above that reference a product in another 
            market. If people make money doing something and MS takes part of 
            that money away using their OS monopoly, they have broken the law.
            The problem stems from the public not even understanding the 
            difference between the competitors and not caring to change. Who's 
            fault is that? 
            It is not Google's job to educate or motivate the people to have to 
            change, rather the onus is upon MS to not make choices in their OS 
            design or settings for people that gain them market share in other 
            markets than desktop OS's. It is part of the price you pay for 
            having a monopoly. When you're really big, the law says you have to 
            watch where you step so you don't crush those smaller.
            In this case, how do you establish that? The OS is entrenched, but 
            Google market share is significant over MSN's search. I mean hell, 
            its almost 50%. How can you argue that your dominance is in danger 
            by a company who holds 8%? 
            MS's market share in Web browsers was 8% once too, before they 
            started bundling it with the OS. Their market share for server OS's 
            was below 8%, before they started tying it to the desktop with 
            secret protocols. Now their products are still inferior, but one has 
            dominated the market entirely and the other is gaining market share. 
            Google has not locked people in in any way to their service. All MS 
            has to do is get their search "good enough" that people won't go out 
            of their way to change settings and they will win with this tactic. 
            That is what is illegal. They aren't winning by producing a product 
            that is better or even as good, just one that is "good enough" and 
            bundled. "Good enough" is not what consumers deserve and the people 
            that make a product that is just "good enough" should not be 
            profiting on it over more innovative companies, just because they 
            already have a monopoly on something else.

            Yet, Microsoft is NOT forcing anyone to adopt it. If you want to 
            change it, you can. If someone is so unlikely to switch that's a 
            laziness/ignorance issue on the part of the end user, not Microsoft. 

            You're wrong, both conceptually and under the letter of the law. 
            Will setting MSN as the default search engine gain MS market share 
            for their service? Yes. Can Google gain the same advantage, not 
            having a monopoly on desktop OS's to use? No. Thus MS has gained an 
            unfair advantage by leveraging their monopoly. That is illegal. 
            Whether or not this exploiting the fact that people are lazy and 
            ignorant does not figure into it.

          Don't believe for one moment that Google's motives are pure and "do no 
          evil".

          Not to make a judgment about Google specifically, but it's entirely 
          possible to have impure motives without doing evil to get there. 
          Motives are about ends, doing evil is about means. (Of course, there 
          are certain ends that you can only achieve by doing evil -- like 
          deciding to f*ing kill someone.)

          One's motive could be to make huge piles of cash, but one could go 
          about it ethically. One could even try to compete on both technical 
          and PR levels.

          I'll think about it for an hour. Still makes sense. Why? Microsoft is 
          a monopoly. Monopolies cannot use their monopoly product (the OS, and 
          according to MS, IE is part of the OS) to leverage other products.
          Now, this is not impossible to be gotten around. The entire reason why 
          Windows XP was shipped one year after Windows 2000 is simple: 
          Microsoft wanted to bundle Windows Messenger, and a new version of IE 
          and Outlook Express with Windows 2000. But they couldn't. How do you 
          get around that?
          Simple: make them an "inseparable" part of a "new" operating system. 
          Voila! Windows XP.
          In any case, the spirit is obvious: MS should not be able to do this.

          Because Firefox does not gain from making Google a default


        Didn't Mozilla.org make a TON of money off of Google referals directly 
        related to the Firefox search box?

          Yeah, Google employs Firefox developers directly and indirectly pays 
          Mozilla salaries. I suppose technically they're independant, but 
          realistically Mozilla.org is a division of Google, Inc.

    The problem with that defense of Firefox and Google is that Firefox doesn't 
    ask you to specify which one you would like to use, it just defaults to it. 
    And as the summary points out, MSN isn't even an option. Google isn't 
    bitching about that, because it is in their favor (default home page is also 
    a Google site), as opposed to IE7, which isn't.

    The stronger case is made in the fact that, when released, IE7 will become 
    the dominant browser on the market. So whatever the default is set to, is 
    probably going to remain on a bulk of the computers it is on. But if someone 
    is going to bitch about setting a default without asking, the same standard 
    should apply to Firefox/Google.

        search engine services. 
      But if someone is going to bitch about setting a default without asking, 
      the same standard should apply to Firefox/Google. 
      The same standard is applied. As soon as either of them gains a monopoly 
      and enters into the other's market (or any other market) they will 
      forbidden from abusing the first monopoly from gaining market share in the

      is declared a monopoly it is illegal for them to intentionally change 
      their search algorithm to always return GoogleOS or GoogleBrowser as the 
      first search result for "OS" or "Web browser."
      Microsoft is in the wrong here.

    Talk about sour grapes.

    When you first install Firefox, the default search provider is Google, and 
    in fact Google even kindly provides their own startup page for Firefox 
users!

    The fact you can easily change the configuration of Internet Explorer 7.0 to 
    default to Google instead of MSN Search shows that (IMO) Microsoft hasn't 
    really done anything wrong.

      The main difference between the IE7 search box and the Firefox and Opera 
      search boxes is that the IE7 search box comes preloaded with only one 
      search provider: MSN. Firefox and Opera both include a half-dozen or so 
      providers when you install them. (You can add additional search engines in 
      all three.)
    Everybody is missing the primary point. You almost got it right, but your 
    first sentence went a few words too long.
    The main difference between the IE7 and the Firefox and Opera is that the 
    IE7 search box comes preloaded. 
    IE will come with any new OS. Firefox and Opera will not.
    IE is, by definition a Default & Preset. IE is forced upon you, Firefox and 
    Opera is chosen.
    That is where the compaint is based from.

      Microsoft is certainly in their right to do this. It's no different. It 
      should make absolutely no difference whether the product being promoted is 
      yours or a third party's.

      It absolutely makes a difference.

      Microsoft is a convicted monopolist. That means the *rules change*. They 
      can no longer just operate normally like a standard, 
      non-convicted-monopolist business can. There is a very strict set of rules 
      they have to follow in order to maintain competition in the marketplace, 
      and these rules are different from those of other companies.

      Google was right to bring this up. Since the Department of Justice doesn't 
      seem interested in following up on the conviction, it is up to the other 
      big players in the industry to point out the ways that Microsoft is 
      violating the anti-trust provisions. The other browsers can default to 
      whichever search engine they want, even if they make money from it. 
      Microsoft cannot.

  From the slashdot summary: 
    I notice that in my version of Firefox the search box defaults to Google, 
    and that the pull-down menu of pre-entered options doesn't even include MSN 
    Search, but Google seems to have been oddly quiet on that front for the many 
    years prior to IE7 that Firefox has made this feature available.
  Google's concern and complaint is Microsoft is once again leveraging their 
  monopoly in their Windows domain to control unfairly users' choice to some 
  other market or product, in this case, search engine choice. It could be 
  problematic, maybe even legally, that Microsoft sets the default search to 
  theirs, even though they offer other choices. I agree with Google's complaint 
  and would like to see Microsoft forced to make choosing the search engine part 
  of the setup procedure. 
  As for the slashdot summary observation Firefox hasn't done the same, Firefox 
  has no monopoly and is therefor in no way obligated in the same way as 
  Microsoft to change the default behavior. 
  As an aside, and a question, has anyone else had trouble with IE7? In keeping 
  with "knowing your enemy", I installed IE7, and it crashes consistently every 
  time I open up a new page in a new tab. Anyone else seen this?

    I agree with the parent post, but I'll attempt to target the real problems 
    with the analogy a little more concretely. 

    The most important difference here is that Google is not a subsidiary or 
    owned by the Mozilla Foundation whereas MSN is owned by Microsoft. 

    Firefox and Google are two companies that are (to my knowledge) completely 
    independent. Firefox can choose whatever search engine they want to set to 
    default. On top of that, you don't pay for Firefox where you kind of paid 
    for IE7. 

    The author's analogy of: 
      I notice that in my version of Firefox the search box defaults to Google, 
      and that the pulldown menu of pre-entered options doesn't even include MSN 
      Search, but Google seems to have been oddly quiet on that front for the 
      many years prior to IE7 that Firefox has made this feature available."
    Is, in my opinion, a poor one. A Mozilla based browser is free for almost 
    any operating system while IE7 is free ... so long as you've purchased 
    Windows [microsoft.com]. 

    To recap, Microsoft putting Microsoft as the default search engine is bad 
    because they are using their operating system and browser market dominance 
    to corner the search engine market. They have no right to do that. Where 
    would we make them stop? It's kind of a slippery slope. It's fine that 
    they've put unlimited funds toward web search and the console market--it's 
    not fine if their forcing or even defaulting their users to themselves in 
    other markets.

  Microsoft is a convicted monopolist, and thus is subject to a different set of 
  rules. If Firefox had 90% of the browser market then things might be 
  different. As it stands, however, Firefox can include or exclude whoever they 
  want. Microsoft may not be able to.

  At least, that's the excuse Google can use. Frankly I'm inclined to think it's 
  "just business".

  I'd hardly call this an antitrust issue. A microsoft product is referrign to a 
  microsoft search engine. It's very easy to change it to use a different one. 
  It's when Microsoft makes it impossible to use anything _BUT_ their own 
  products that there's serious problems. Case in point is the inability to 
  'remove' IE at all, and Microsoft's assertion that it was impossible to do so 
  (then later making versions of windows that have IE removed).

  I think Google is starting to feel the pinch. They've tweaked the lumbering 
  behemoth that is Microsoft, and Billy boy is fighting back the best way he 
  can. Back room deals, silent contracts, and subtle manipulation of the market. 
  Google should be more worried about Microsoft pushing their products into the 
  colleges and large businesses, not what the default search engine on one box 
  in one browser is.

        If you want to push this argument, I have to tell you that Google is 
        very close to being a monopoly, and that is exactly how they got Firefox 
        to default to them.


      Its not illegal to be a monopoly (and even less so a near monopoly) in one 
      market and, as a result of that, to have other players then promote your 
      monopoly (or near-monopoly) product in its own market.

      It is illegal to leverage your monopoly power in one market to gain an 
      unfair advantage in another market.

      Now, my guess is that using MSN search as a default in IE (which, IIRC, 
      predates IE7; if you type an invalid address into the IE6 address bar the 
      default behavior, ISTR, is an MSN search -- I can't check because even 
      though I have IE6, mine has Google Toolbar which replaces the default 
      behavior with a Google search) probably doesn't reach to that level, and, 
      insofar as it does, the IE7 search box behavior is probably less 
      problematic than the pre-IE7 address bar behavior.

      But to pretend that there was some parallel between Microsoft using its OS 
      dominance to push the MSN search system through the IE browser it 
      controls, and Google using its search dominance to push Google search 
      through the Firefox browser which it doesn't control is, well, missing the 
      point rather badly.

    It's the default browser in Vista, come '07 your statement is wrong. And 
    that's the big problem here. IE is bundled with an OS (Vista) and Firefox is 
    not. If IE was a completely seperate application then I'd have no problem 
    here, but with Vista that is not the case.

    On another note, Google doesn't own Safari or Firefox, so they can pick 
    whatever default search they want.

  I agree that Google is being a bit hypcritical here. It makes business sense 
  that they don't want MSN to be the default, especially since Microsoft is also 
  muscling into the search engine wars, but I think their case would have been 
  stronger if they'd included MSN search in their search options on 
  installation. Then again, part of me is wondering if that might not have 
  caused legal problems in and of itself. "Appropriation of competiting 
  technology and repackaging under a different brand name" or somesuch.

  It's not Googles job to cry foul over things that benefit them. Especially, 
  when it is a third party software.

  Complaining about Google being default in Firefox is Microsofts job (or Yahoo 
  or someone else). However, if Microsoft had complained about that they would 
  have _had_ to make it optional in IE7 as well. So, Microsoft kept quiet about 
  that.

  If Google had complained about them being the default in FireFox then they 
  would have been on the moral high ground when complaining about IE7. But they 
  wouldn't be in a much better position to convince Microsoft though.

  " Google goes on to assert that the move "limits consumer choice and is

  I like Google, but this does not limit consumer choice. IE7 doesn't *block* 
  google's web site. You can add Google search to their search box....

  Antitrust would be if when you go to google.com or altavista.com and what not 
  and it automatically goes to MSN.com. And if you use Google in the search box 
  it doesn't limit the searches. Sorry. Google's wrong this one. And they should 
  be careful now. Backwards steps can cause a giant to fall.

  Microsoft owns their browser and is using it to leverage their other 
  property--MSN search, or whatever they're calling it these days. Google does 
  NOT own Firefox--Firefox is a third party. Microsoft is using one hand of 
  their monopolistic giant to put money into their other hand. Google is not, 
  and as such, as a valid point, IMHO.

  That said, of COURSE it works to their [Google's] advantage that Firefox 
  behaves in such a manner. However, that doesn't mean that the Mozilla 
  Foundation isn't free to switch their default over to MSN if their user base 
  overwhelmingly requests it.

  I installed one of the first IE7 beta releases. I was surprised that the new 
  search box includes a drop down that lets you change to AOL, Yahoo, Google, or 
  Ask Jeeves (but defaults to MSN). I selected Google once, it worked as 
  expected, but the next time I launched IE, it was set back to MSN Search. 
  Without digging much further, I figured that was just how it had to be... 
  Microsoft was giving space to the others, but still asserting its control.

  Then when I browsed to the Google homepage, I got a little DHTML pop-up window 
  that said something to the effect of "hey, you're using IE7, wanna change the 
  default for your searchbox to use Google?" Perfect, I had wanted to do that, 
  and I guess they figured out how. So I press OK. I restarted IE7, and sure 
  enough, my default search was now Google. Thanks Google.

  Except, a funny thing happened when I let Google change my settings. That list 
  of alternate search engines that Microsoft had provided, for the user's 
  benefit, was now replaced by a single choice: Google. Yes, I wanted Google as 
  my default, but I never said I wanted Google as the only choice! That's 
  annoying.

  That is when I noticed the Search Settings... menu option at the bottom of the 
  search bar's menu. It includes a Restore Defaults... button, which does 
  exactly that. I clicked it, and all of my search engines were back (and MSN 
  Search was back to being the default). From that Search Settings screen, I 
  selected Google, and clicked Set Default. Now Google was my default search 
  engine, AND I still had the choice of selecting a different engine from the 
  drop down. That is what I wanted. Why didn't Google give me what I wanted?

  Exactly. The last thing I want when I install a new piece of software is it 
  asking me a bunch of silly questions like this. I like the FF way: A box that 
  lets me search, it show where it is searching (the big G), and it has an entry 
  for "Add more."

  Microsoft should be free to choose whatever default they want and not add 
  anyone else by default.
